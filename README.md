<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Chuka</h1>
I am a Junior Fullstack Engineer based in London. Having a passion for technology and the desire to solve real-world problems inspired me to become a software developer at an early age. I am dedicated, enthusiastic, career-driven, and always glad to learn new skills and take on new challenges.

<br>It is my strength to pay attention to details, work well in teams, and communicate effectively. My previous work experience was in sales for start-up companies for the last four years, and now I am interested in applying those skills to my career as a Software Developer.

| [Tonight's Dinner][5] | An individual project made after graduating from Makers. A web app that allows me to input and store the dinners I cook in the evening, helpful for tracking what I eat and what I can make. Targeted at those that trouble with what to make for dinner, with a feature that displays a random food input when clicked. | Ruby on Rails, Capybara, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS |
| [Pin My Hike][1] | A webapp that allows users to "pin" and save their favourite hikes in real-time, also has a function that shows their current location in case they are stuck on a route. Suited for outdoor users who need to highlight their travels in more detail and share. | MERN, Javascript, ESLint, CircleCI |
| [MakersBnB][3] | A replication of the Airbnb platform, where users can find local holiday/rental spaces. Suited for holiday-makers and travellers if they want to stay at a local home-stay instead of hotels.  | Ruby, Capybara, HTML, CSS |

## Skills
- **Constant learner** - Can transfer between languages (Ruby and Javascript) as I love to code. While still eager to learn new technologies like React.
- **Enthusiasm** - I am always eager to contribute to a project, unafraid to add my ideas to a conversation, like enquiring about which coding tasks are more important. 
- **Teamwork** - I enjoy working in both team environments whilst being confident enough to work independently. Always getting positive feedback during pair programming sessions and team projects.
- **Written and Verbal Communication Skills** - I held multiple presentations on business development plans at my previous jobs and wrote a [blog][4] that details my entire 12-week Makers Academy duration.
- **Attention to detail** - I am good at spotting key items when doing code reviews or pair programming, which has dramatically improved when debugging.
- **Flexibility** - Easily adaptable to taking on available duties, and very comfortable working with new people effectively.
